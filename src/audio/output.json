  "This is getting repeatitive.": 1.8,
  "One variable equations are equations where there is just a single unknown to solve for.": 5.496,
  "Let's just start with a simple example:": 2.712,
  "Solve X plus 5, equals to 15.": 3.192,
  "Firstly, what do you understand by the question?": 3.072,
  "Really? The obviously correct options is: we are looking for values of X which satisfy the equation.": 6.768,
  "May I remind you that you should always pick the correct option.": 3.912,
  "I will occassionally give obviously wrong options to keep you on your toes!": 4.608,
  "So, choosing the correct option will lead to faster progress!": 4.104,
  "That's right!": 1.104,
  "Now, as a reminder, a value of X satisfies the equation, if when you substitute or replace X with that value, the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side of the equation are equal.": 12.504,
  "Or more precisely, the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side of the equation evaluates to equal values.": 6.768,
  "A good strategy to solve one variable equations is to apply rules of algebra to the equation,": 6.072,
  "until we get X by itself on one side of the equation.": 4.272,
  "In this example, on the left side, we have X plus 5, what same change both sides can we make to cancel the  plus 5?": 7.872,
  "This change is valid, as we did the same thing to both sides,": 4.392,
  "but it is not useful, as in the new left-hand-side of X plus 5 plus 5 the  plus 5 and  plus 5 do not cancel each other,": 8.4,
  "or X plus 5 plus 5 simplifies to X plus 10, and we would like it to simplify to just X.": 6.84,
  "A valid and useful change is minus 5 on both sides.": 4.08,
  "but it is not useful, as in the new left-hand-side of X plus 5 minus 15 the  plus 5 and minus 15 do not cancel each other,": 8.808,
  "or X plus 5 minus 15 simplifies to X minus 10, and we would like it to simplify to just X.": 7.248,
  "Very good, this is not only valid, but a useful change.": 4.272,
  "Now the left-hand-side is X minus 5 plus 5, the minus 5 plus 5 is the same as 0, that is, they cancel each other,": 8.808,
  "therefore X minus 5 plus 5, equals to X, and we can substitute the left-hand-side of X minus 5 plus 5 with just X!": 9.216,
  "Also, the right-hand-side of 15 minus 5 is equal to 10, so we can substitute the right-hand-side with 10.": 7.632,
  "So it appears X, equals to 10, and the equation is solved!": 4.56,
  "This example is obviously very simple,": 2.808,
  "However, it demonstrates how the equation is solved by repeated applications of rules of algebra.": 6.12,
  "Of coures, we must make good choices on how we apply the rules of algebra.": 4.872,
  "Let's try another example.": 1.944,
  "Here it is": 1.104,
  "Example 2": 1.344,
  "Solve 2 X minus 7, equals to 19.": 3.672,
  "What should we do first?": 1.8,
  "Well done, good idea.": 1.872,
  "2 X minus 7 plus 7, equals to 19 plus 7": 4.848,
  "This is valid but not helpful.": 2.232,
  "Since the left-hand-side would be 2 X minus 7 minus 7,": 4.8,
  "and the first minus 7 and the second minus 7 do not cancel each other.": 4.968,
  "The useful change to make is  plus 7 on both sides of the equation.": 4.824,
  "The left-hand-side will become 2 X divided by 2, or 2 X minus 7 over 2.": 6.336,
  "so then there are no obvious cancellations.": 2.928,
  "This  plus 7 on both sides is useful,": 2.952,
  "since on the left-hand-side of 2 X minus 7 plus 7 is equal to just 2 X, we can substitute it with 2 X.": 8.184,
  "Also, the right-hand-side 19 plus 7 is equal to 26, so we can substitute it with 26.": 7.584,
  "So 2 X equals to 26": 2.808,
  "This step makes the X side simplier, so we are making progress!": 4.632,
  "What should we do next?": 1.752,
  "This is not a valid change, since you did not make the same changes to both sides.": 5.568,
  "The valid and useful change to both sides is divided by 2.": 4.536,
  "Not quite, this is a valid change, but not useful,": 3.96,
  "since if we did this, on the left-hand-side we now have 2 X divided by 26.": 6.144,
  "and there are no cancellations to be made.": 2.664,
  "Correct, very good!": 1.704,
  "2 X divided by 2 is equal to 26 divided by 2.": 4.992,
  "This divide by 2 on both sides is useful,": 3.24,
  "since on the left-hand-side 2 X divided by 2, is equal to X times 2, divided by 2.  Which is equal to X. So we can just substitute 2 X divided by 2 with just X.": 13.032,
  "Also, the right-hand-side 26 divided by 2 is equal to 13, so we can substitute it with 13.": 7.68,
  "So x equals to 13.": 2.28,
  "Great, it appears we have solved the equation, the value of X which satisfy the equation is 13!": 6.6,
  "Right, let's do one more!": 2.112,
  "Example 3": 1.368,
  "Solve 9 X plus 13 over 4 minus 11, equals to 8.": 5.208,
  "So, what should we do first?": 2.184,
  "Not quite, if we did this, the left-hand-side will become 9 X plus 13 over 4 minus 11 times 4 which is the same as 9 X plus 13 minus 44.": 11.208,
  "Therefore, although the change is valid, it does not result in useful cancellations.": 5.472,
  "The correct change to make is  plus 11 on both sides.": 3.792,
  "Not quite, if we did this, the left-hand-side will become 9 X plus 13 over 4 minus 11 minus 13.": 8.088,
  "The  plus 13 and the minus 13 clearly do not cancel, as the  plus 13 is in the numerator of the 9 X plus 13 over 4 and the minus 13 I S N O T.": 10.92,
  "Very good! Let's do it.": 2.16,
  "9 X plus 13 over 4 minus 11 plus 11, equals to 8 plus 11": 6.048,
  "Now on the left-hand-side, let's cancel the minus 11 and  plus 11. As theoretically reminder: this is really an substitute, since 9 X plus 13 over 4 minus 11 plus 11 is equal to 9 X plus 13 over 4.": 15.504,
  "On the right-hand-side, we can substitute 8 plus 11 with 19.": 4.944,
  "So we get 9 X plus 13 over 4 equals to 19.": 4.704,
  "What shall we do next?": 1.824,
  "Not quite, if we did this, the left-hand-side will become 9 X plus 13 over 4 minus 13.": 7.248,
  "The  plus 13 and the minus 13 clearly do not cancel as the  plus 13 is in the numerator of the 9 X plus 13 over 4 and the minus 13 I S N O T.": 10.848,
  "The correct change to make is 4 on both sides.": 3.36,
  "Not quite, if we did this, the left-hand-side will become 9 X plus 13 over 4 divided by 9.": 7.32,
  "Well, there are no obvious cancellations in this case.": 3.528,
  "Yep, very good.": 1.344,
  "Now, on the left-hand-side, we can substitute 9 X plus 13 over 4 times 4 with 9 X plus 13,": 7.92,
  "and on the right-hand-side, we can substitute 19 times 4 with 76": 5.736,
  "So that 9 X plus 13 equals to 76.": 3.888,
  "This is now very similar to the previous examples. Try to solve it yourself and tell me the answer.": 6.408,
  "Let me confirm this on the whiteboard.": 2.424,
  "9 X plus 13 minus 13, equals to 76 minus 13": 5.832,
  "9 X, equals to 63": 2.64,
  "and now": 0.84,
  "So finally, X equals to 7.": 2.664,
  "Not quite, let's me show you on the whiteboard.": 2.952,
  "We have gone through a few examples of solving one variable equations using the rules of algebra.": 5.928,
  "It is interesting to see how these seemingly simple rules of algebra can be used to solve increasingly complex equations.": 7.56,
  "We are making progress on equation solving!": 2.88,
  "Let's try something simpler:": 1.944,
  "Example 4": 1.344,
  "Solve 10 minus X, equals to 4.": 3.024,
  "I promise there is a very important point to this seemingly simple example, so let's solve it through rigorous applications of rules of algebra as usual.": 9.024,
  "Well done, this is a good idea, since the left-hand-side will become 10 minus X minus 10, which is the simplifies as follows:": 8.424,
  "10 minus X minus 10, equals to 10 minus X minus 10.": 5.016,
  "However, on this occassion, I would like to lead you to a different path to the solution instead.": 5.736,
  "Let's  plus X on both sides.": 2.52,
  "10 minus X plus X, equals to 4 plus X": 3.84,
  "Excellent idea, let's do it.": 2.472,
  "This is not a valid substitute, since 10 minus X is not equal to X minus 10 in general!": 6.672,
  "For example 7 minus 3, equals to 3 minus 7, so the change you suggested is not valid.": 6.84,
  "A valid and useful change to make, for example, is  plus X on both sides.": 5.688,
  "Not quit, even though this is a valid same change both sides,it is not useful.": 5.544,
  "This is because in 10 minus X plus 10 do not yield any useful cancellations: 10 minus X plus 10, equals to 10 plus 10 minus X, this is the best we can do, and is still not very useful.": 12.6,
  "It is a rather strange thing to do, adding a variable to both sides!": 4.752,
  "It is definitely valid, since we are making the same changes to both sides of the equation.": 5.76,
  "Go with it for now, it will be shortly revealed why this change is super userful!": 5.232,
  "Now, the left-hand-side 10 minus X plus X is in fact the same as, or equal to 10. So we can substitute 10 minus X plus X with 10.": 10.056,
  "The right-hand-side 4 plus X is the same as X plus 4, so let's make these substitutions.": 6.72,
  "10, equals to X plus 4": 2.424,
  "Now, we have a much simpler equation, which we can solve in the next step! So, what should we do next?": 6.936,
  "Not quite, this is a valid change, but not useful.": 3.936,
  "Since if we did this, on the right-hand-side we now have X plus 4 minus 10, and there are no useful cancellations to be made.": 8.232,
  "A valid and useful change to both sides is minus 4.": 3.84,
  "10 minus 4, equals to X plus 4 minus 4": 3.816,
  "Yep, good choice.": 1.488,
  "minus 4 on both sides is useful, because now the left-hand-side is the same as 6 so we can substitute it with 6.": 7.92,
  "The right-hand-side X plus 4 minus 4, equals to X, and so we can substitute it with just X, and it appears we have solved the equation!": 9.048,
  "6, equals to X": 2.04,
  "Even though we were able to do the question using rules of algebra, it was rather...awkward.": 5.52,
  "Nevermind...let's try one more example.": 2.952,
  "Example 5.": 1.416,
  "Example 5": 1.416,
  "Solve 42 over 11 minus 36 over X, equals to 6.": 5.616,
  "What shall we do first?": 1.848,
  "Yes, this will be helpful.": 2.04,
  "We get a big cancellation on the left-hand-side, and on the right-hand-side we can expand, to get:": 6.312,
  "42, equals to 66 minus 216 over X": 5.544,
  "This is not very helpful, as this gives us no obvious cancellations, since 32 over X is all the way inside the denominator of a fraction.": 8.952,
  "Instead, the following change is helpful, I will put this on the board.": 4.56,
  "42 over 11 minus 36 over X times 11 minus 36 over X, equals to 6 times 11 minus 36 over X": 10.2,
  "We get a big cancellation on the left-hand-side, and we can expand the right-hand-side .": 5.616,
  "This is not helpful, s this gives us no obvious cancellations.  Since the 11 minus is all the way inside the denominator of a fraction.": 9.336,
  "Instead, multiplying both sides by 11 minus 36 over X is helpful:": 6,
  "And now, what shall we do?": 2.04,
  "This is not that helpful.": 1.824,
  "Our biggest pain point right now is the X in the denominator of 216 over X, and dividing both sides by 216 does not solve this problem.": 10.344,
  "Instead, let's try multiply both sides by X.": 3.6,
  "42 X, equals to 66 minus 216 over X times X": 6.408,
  "Good idea.": 1.056,
  "Expand and simplify both sides:": 2.784,
  "42 X, equals to 66 X minus 216 over X times X": 6.696,
  "42 X, equals to 66 X minus 216": 5.4,
  "This is helpful, since we no longer have X in the denominators of any fraction.": 5.256,
  "Can you find the value of X now?": 2.256,
  "Not quite, let's do it together on the board:": 3,
  "First add 216 on both sides.": 3.456,
  "Minus 216 and plus 216 cancel each other on the right side.": 6.144,
  "Now minus 42 X on both sides.": 3.24,
  "216, equals to 24 X": 3.6,
  "Finally divide both sides by 24.": 3.12,
  "So 9 equals to X.": 2.16,
  "Correct, well done! and so X, equals to 9!": 4.032,
  "Even though we did manage to solve the equation by applying rules of algebra, but this feels anything but easy.": 6.624,
  "It is important to understand that applying rules of algebra can allow you to solve almost any one variable equation, but it's not always easy!": 8.592,
  "Next, I am going to show you a new way to solve these equations, which is easier and much more effective.": 6.384,
  "In fact, it is so effective, that you will be able to solve example 5 mentally!": 5.448,
  "There are two basic rules of algebra, which we use to manipulate mathematical expressions in general.": 6.336,
  "You have already been using these rules for a very long time, but you may not realise exactly what they are!": 6.288,
  "You use the rules when for example when you write 1 plus 1, equals to 2,": 5.256,
  "as well as when you solve X plus 5, equals to 7 by doing X plus 5 minus 5, equals to 7 minus 5 to get X, equals to 2.": 9.72,
  "Now it's time to really understand what you are doing and why it works!": 4.416,
  "Deep understanding of these simple ideas will have profound consequences later.": 4.8,
  "Anyway, here are the rules of algebra: exchange of equals and same change both sides.": 5.904,
  "Let's start with exchange of equals.": 2.616,
  "Exchange of equals means that you can exchange any part of a mathematical expression with something which is equal to it.": 7.08,
  "Let's start with a basic example.": 2.448,
  "Example 1": 3.864,
  "2 X plus 3 X plus 7": 2.448,
  "Inside of the expression 2 X plus 3 X plus 7, we have 2 X plus 3 X, and since 2 X plus 3 X, equals to 5 X, we can replace 2 X plus 3 X with 5 X.": 12.72,
  "So we can say 2 X plus 3 X plus 7 is the same as, or equal to 5 X plus 7.": 6.696,
  "So we applied exchange of equals to exchange 2 X plus 3 X with 5 X and copied the plus 7 which we are not changing.": 8.4,
  "This is how 2 X plus 3 X plus 7 became 5 X plus 7.": 5.448,
  "Let's do another quick example, again starting with 2 X plus 3 X plus 7.": 5.76,
  "Which of the following is a correct application of exchange of equals to 2 X plus 3 X plus 7?": 6.48,
  "Not quite right, as plus 7 has been exchanged with plus 2 plus 4.": 5.256,
  "This is not a valid exchange of equals, since they are not equal!": 4.464,
  "Where as 2 X plus 3 X plus 7, equals to 2 X plus 3 X plus 1 plus 3 plus 5 minus 2 is a correct application of exchange of equals,": 10.632,
  "here plus 7 has been exchanged with plus 1 plus 3 plus 5 minus 2, these are in fact equal, so it is valid.": 8.04,
  "Well done, this is a valid exchange of equals:": 3.24,
  "Plus 7 has been exchanged with plus 1 plus 3 plus 5 minus 2, and since they are equal, it is valid": 7.44,
  "Out of the two rules of algebra, exchange of equals is the most fundamental.": 5.16,
  "You will find that most of the algebraic manipulations you do are through exchange of equals.": 5.64,
  "Alright, that's it for this session, time to see how well you really understood it all!": 5.304,
  "Our second rule of algebra is same change both sides.": 3.792,
  "This second rule can only be applied to an equation,": 3.336,
  "where as the first rule of algebra exchange of equals can be applied to any mathematical expression.": 6.144,
  "Let's demonstrate same change both sideswith an example.": 3.864,
  "X plus 5, equals to 7": 3.864,
  "X plus 5, equals to 7 being an equation means that its left-hand-side is equal to its right-hand-side.": 7.2,
  "To preserve this equality, we could, for example:": 3.216,
  "add 5 to both sides of it.": 2.328,
  "X plus 5 plus 5, equals to 7 plus 5": 2.328,
  "Since we are making the same change to both sides of the equation,": 4.32,
  "equality is preserved, and so it is a valid change.": 3.48,
  "This is an example of same change both sides to an equation.": 4.416,
  "Notice I put brackets around the left and right sides of the equation,": 4.728,
  "this is to ensure that we are making the same changes to the entire left-hand-side and the entire right-hand-side.": 6.984,
  "In this particular case, the change is  plus 5, and so with, or without these brackets, it makes no difference:": 7.176,
  "This is actually a subtle example of exchange of equals.": 3.624,
  "Anyway,  plus 5 to both sides is a valid application of same change both sides,": 5.976,
  "but it is not a very useful one, as it obviously does not help us to solve this simple equation!": 6.096,
  "Which of the following is a useful application of same change both sides to help us solve the equation?": 6.168,
  "Not quite,": 1.128,
  "a useful choice is minus 5 on both sides,": 3.504,
  "X plus 5 minus 5, equals to 7 minus 5": 3.84,
  "X, equals to 2": 3.84,
  "Correct, very good.": 1.632,
  "This is a useful application of same change both sides,": 3.84,
  "So this is same change both sides!": 2.784,
  "Next, why don't you try some questions to see if you really understand the concept of same change both sides.": 6.888,
  "This is not a valid substitution, since 10 minus X is not equal to X minus 10 in general!": 6.792,
  "Go with it for now, it will be shortly revealed why this change is super useful!": 5.112,
  "For example 7 minus 3, is not equal to 3 minus 7, so the change you suggested is not valid.": 7.08,
  "Hello again!": 1.176,
  "In this lesson, we will be looking at sequences": 3.192,
  "Good question!": 1.152,
  "Well, let me show you some examples": 2.664,
  "In maths, a sequence is an ordered set of numbers": 3.432,
  "But they aren't just any ordinary numbers placed in any order": 3.6,
  "Every term depends on the previous one, and the previous one depends on the previous one and so on": 6.168,
  "Let's have a look at the first sequence": 2.688,
  "Each number in a sequence is called a term": 2.832,
  "And we use its position to identify it": 2.88,
  "First term, U 1 is 1": 2.328,
  "Second term, U 2 is 4": 2.472,
  "Third term, U 3 is 7": 2.448,
  "In that case, what is the forth term of that sequence?": 3.792,
  "Correct!": 0.912,
  "Forth term of that sequence is 10": 2.592,
  "Not quite right": 1.392,
  "Forth term of a sequence is the term in the forth position": 3.96,
  "In this case forth term is equal to 10": 2.976,
  "And what is the U 6 of that sequence?": 2.736,
  "Sixth term of that sequence is 16": 2.88,
  "Not quite": 1.128,
  "U 6 is the sixth term of the sequence": 3,
  "In this sequence sixth term is equal to 16": 3.408,
  "We know now how to identify the terms, but what makes sequences interesting are the patterns between the terms": 6.816,
  "Can you spot any patterns in this sequence?": 2.832,
  "What do we need to do to get from U 1 to U 2, from U 2 to U 3?": 5.112,
  "Not really": 1.08,
  "The only way we can get from 1 to 4 and from 4 to 7 is by adding 3": 5.304,
  "Let's write it in a more general way": 2.568,
  "Second term is first term + 3": 2.784,
  "Third term is second term + 3": 2.784,
  "Therefore we can write this more generally": 2.544,
  "To obtain the next term, we need to take the current term and add 3": 4.608,
  "Sure!": 0.744,
  "When we define a general term using previous terms, we call it a recurrence relation": 5.616,
  "In this sequence new term can be formed by adding 3 to the previous one": 4.872,
  "So let's use U N to mean the current term and U N+1 to mean the next term": 5.712,
  "Mathematically we can write it like this": 2.76,
  "U N = U N+1 + 3": 3.096,
  "In the next couple of sessions we will be heavily using recurrence relations": 4.848,
  "So it's important for you to understand what they represent.": 3.576,
  "Do you want me to recap what recurrence relations are?": 3.096,
  "Sure thing!": 1.056,
  "What we are trying to do is find a pattern which lets us find any term in the sequence": 5.424,
  "U N represents a current term that we are looking at": 3.336,
  "While U n+1 represents the next term in the sequence": 4.464,
  "By finding the recurrence relation U n+1 = U n + 3 we can find any term in the sequence if we know its preceding term": 9.048,
  "That's it when it comes to our introduction to sequences!": 3.576,
  "This is another test speech!": 2.112,
  "This is yet another test.": 1.92
